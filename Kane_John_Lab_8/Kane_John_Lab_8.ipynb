    "Being someone who is very interested in television, especially from a review standpoint, I am always looking for the best rated episodes on imdb. And while these episodes can be found, it takes quite a lot of digging and there is really no easy or efficient way of doing this. Using this omdb API, I would like to create a program which runs through television series, and shows the top rated episodes, in order to give a comprehensive and easy to view list of the top imdb rated television episodes of different series. And while I was able to do this for a singular season of Better Call Saul, I am unsure what efficient method I would have to use to go through many more shows with the API, and pull their top rated episodes, but I certainly think it would be something that would benefit a great many people.
